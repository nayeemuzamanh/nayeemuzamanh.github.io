        <p>By signing up and actively using the Visit Earn program, you agree to all terms and conditions set forth in this membership agreement. Visit Earn may, at any time, choose to edit, add and/or delete portions of this agreement and impose changes without prior notification of its members. We will endeavor to send out a notice to all our members regarding the new terms and/or terms which have changed. If any modification is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate your Visit Earn account. Your continued participation in Visit Earn following our posting of a change in policy notice or new agreement on our site will constitute your binding acceptance to the change. You agree and acknowledge that you will review this agreement on a regular basis and you further agree that upon logging in and viewing the site you are deemed to have reviewed and accepted the latest revisions/modifications to this membership agreement.</p>
        <h2>1. ELIGIBILITY</h2>
        <p>You must be 18 years of age or older to participate in Visit Earn. Visit Earn is open to US and International members and is void where prohibited by local governing laws.</p>
        <p>In an effort to ensure the integrity of the Visit Earn advertising program, the persons in any of the following categories are NOT eligible to participate in the Visit Earn program in the capacity of ad viewer: (a) persons who are employees or agents of Visit Earn, or its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or service agencies, or independent contractors of any of the above organizations; and (b) persons who are immediate family (defined as mother, father, sister, brother, daughter, son or spouse) of any person in any of the preceding categories, regardless of where they live. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a person’s right to maintain a Visit Earn account for advertising purposes nor does this policy restrict the promotion of a person’s affiliate link.</p>
        <h2>2. RESPONSIBILITY OF MEMBERS</h2>
        <p>You will use your username / password combination to access your account and it is your responsibility to keep this information confidential. You may change this information by logging into your account and following the "Profile and Settings" link. You are solely responsible for any and all use of your Visit Earn account including authorization by you to any third party individual who may use your account. Any unauthorized access to your account should be reported immediately.</p>
        <p>Should Visit Earn detect any instances of fraud, system abuse, defamation, harassment, foul language, inappropriate conduct in our forum or helpdesk or any type of account activity deemed to be inappropriate or illegal in the sole discretion of Visit Earn, these actions may result in member termination and possible legal action as well as forfeiture of any earned commissions not yet disbursed to you from Visit Earn. In the event that you have taken inappropriate actions in attempting to cheat, steal, lie or any action that would violate the Visit Earn User Agreement or the User Agreement of any 3rd party company that Visit Earn has a partnership agreement with, Visit Earn can at it's own discretion turn over any and all evidence, information, personal data and logs to said 3rd party for possible prosecution or investigation.</p>
        <p>Inactivity - If your account should go to inactive status (90 days with no logins), Visit Earn will consider the account abandoned and it will be closed. Visit Earn will send email reminders at 7, 30 & 83 days reminding you that if you fail to login your account will be closed. After account closure, all funds (money) in the account will be forfeited and the balance zeroed. If you reopen this account the balance that was reclaimed will not be credited back. Any referrals in your downline when it's closed for inactivity will remain in the account. Any unspent ad credits are also reclaimed when an inactive account is closed. While this account is inactive, any referrals in your downline may request to change their sponsor. If you reactivate your account these referrals who left your downline will not be assigned back, they are lost.</p>
        <p>Account Selling/Renting - Visit Earn does not allow you to sell or rent your account. In the event you attempt to sell or rent your account, the account will be limited with no access. Visit Earn is free to join and the selling or renting of your account to make a profit from your activities here is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <p>Sponsor Changes - The changing of or removing an affiliate sponsor is not permitted. The management of Visit Earn may at its discretion allow the changing of a sponsor, IF and only if the affiliate does not have a sponsor assigned or the current sponsor has been inactive for more than 90 days. There are no exceptions to this rule. Visit Earn strongly suggests that you do not close your account and open a new one so you can change your sponsor. Visit Earn can at our own discretion not allow this activity to happen, especially if its to join a team.</p>
        <p>Offers, Tasks and Surveys - Visit Earn has agreements with many different 3rd party companies to provide our members with Tasks, Offers and Surveys. In the event that you are not compensated or rewarded for such completion of said survey, task or offer Visit Earn will attempt to find out why you were not rewarded correctly but will not be responsible for completing a payment if the Offer, Survey or Task Company refuses to follow through and reward you. ANY member that attempts to cheat to complete a task, offer or survey will have their account permanently suspended without question. The use of a proxy server or VPN to access or complete said offers, tasks or surveys is prohibited. All funds accrued from illegal access or from attempting to cheat will be forfeited.</p>
        <p>Account Verification - Members who reside in the USA & Canada are required to have their postal address verified prior to be eligible for electronic cashouts (Payza, PayToo, Skrill, Tango Card, Payoneer). Address verification is accomplished by sending you a check to the address on your Visit Earn account profile. The check will be delivered by USPS (United States Postal Service) First Class Mail. Failure to verify your address can result in account closure and forfeiture of any account balance. Visit Earn reserves the right to request address or personal verification for any and all accounts without stating a reason. In the event that your Visit Earn account goes to inactive status (closed) or you close your account and then reactivate it, you must complete address verification again even if you have done it in the past. This is necessary to combat fraud. If such a request is made of a member and subsequently refused or ignored, Visit Earn reserves the right to withhold funds and or close the account. If after entering the pin code printed on the check you fail to cash this check, Visit Earn can void your address verification. You must also cash the check to complete address verification. Visit Earn may at it's own discretion request id verification from you in order to prove you are the person you claim to be. Id verification will include a copy of your passport or drivers license and may also include a copy of a utility bill in your name. Failure to provide adequate proof of identity will result in loss of Visit Earn account and earnings. </p>
        <p>Relocation - In the event that you permanently or temporarily move to a different country, you must inform Visit Earn once you have arrived at your new location so we can update your profile. If you happen to travel to different countries with your job or in vacation, your profile must remain set to your home country as we will not update your country if you are not staying in each location for more than 90 days. There are no exceptions to this policy.</p>
        <p>Affiliate Program - As a member of Visit Earn you are automatically enrolled in our affiliate program. The member who brought you here (your sponsor) will earn commissions from the various money generating activities that you complete on Visit Earn. In the event you join without a sponsor you may elect to assign one or continue without a sponsor. Visit Earn does not allow you to create multiple accounts, run another account or attempt to create bogus referral accounts in order to increase your earning potential. Visit Earn can at its own discretion remove any member it feels that may have been created that violates our terms. Visit Earn does not allow members from the same household to be in the same affiliate downline and will remove all affiliates from the same household. You can view the affiliate program commission structure on this page.</p>

In addition, you grant Visit Earn the right to access, index and cache the site(s), or any portion thereof, including by automated means.</p>
        <h2>9. PAYMENTS / CASHOUTS</h2>

        <p>You may not promote your referral links through unsolicited emailing (i.e. SPAMMING), newsgroup postings, job sites, classified ad sites or any other method of mass communication. Failure to comply will result in immediate termination of your membership with Visit Earn, and may result in legal prosecution. Visit Earn strictly enforces anti-Spamming laws. Spamming is a federal crime. Any member caught Spamming will not only have their account terminated immediately and lose any past, present and future earnings, but shall also be held liable for spamming as we shall cooperate with any authorities and investigations that may arise from the spamming incident. Visit Earn may fine your account up to $50 per spam email or posted website that is reported to us.</p>
        <h2>11. ACCOUNT ABUSE</h2>
        <p>Multiple registrations and/or running multiple accounts shall be grounds for immediate termination of all involved accounts. Registering multiple accounts from the same IP address or from the same computer also constitutes fraud. Any use of Internet bots, also known as web robots or simply bots would be ground for immediate termination of your Visit Earn account. Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human editor alone. Visit Earn may file charges for recovery of any earnings received from multiple registrations or any other type fraud or abuse outlined within this membership agreement. This conduct will result in the forfeiture of any Visit Earn earnings you have generated. It is agreed between the member and Visit Earn that determining the specific dollar amount of damages sustained to the reputation of Visit Earn as a result of the fraudulent actions of either our advertisers or our members would be in some cases difficult to prove. Visit Earn takes seriously our obligation to protect our advertisers to be sure they are getting the true value of their investment dollars. For that reason, any breach of this agreement would automatically result in liquidated damages of $1500 in addition to any actual damages sustained by Visit Earn. Visit Earn reserves the right in their discretion to suspend an account upon investigation and conclusion that a fraudulent or deceptive act is occurring or likely to occur.</p>
        <p>Visit Earn does not allow the use of anonymizer or proxy servers to access our system. Visit Earn can at its own discretion block any member who knowingly accesses our system with an anonymizing, VPN or proxy server. We can and will suspend any account found to violate this policy. All funds in your Visit Earn account are immediately forfeited if your account is suspended for violating this policy.</p>
        <p>In the event that you issue a chargeback on a transaction you completed while logged into your Visit Earn account, Visit Earn will suspend your account. A transaction is defined as a purchase that you knowingly made for service or product associated with Visit Earn. Visit Earn may at its discretion take you (the member who issued the chargeback) to small claims court to recover fees associated with the chargeback, including travel expenses incurred to file the necessary court paperwork. Visit Earn records all user activity while you (the member) are logged in. This includes the IP address that you accessed your account from, browser, and all clicks and pages accessed during your login. This information may be used to prove you did indeed authorize the transaction(s) in question. If you wish to have your account "unsuspended" you must agree to pay the initial transaction cost plus a $20 chargeback fee. This payment must be made in the form of a Bank Money order and mailed to: Visit Earn.com, 210 Bates Retreat, Hampstead NC 28443, USA support@Visit Earn.com. Under no circumstances will Visit Earn reinstate an account that has issued a chargeback until such chargeback and initial transaction fees are paid.</p>
